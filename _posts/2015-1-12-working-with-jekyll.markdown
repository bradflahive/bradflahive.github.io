Jekyll is pretty straight forward and easy to work with. These first few posts I will be trying to get to know Jekyll and how it works, and how far I can push it. Definitely a great tool to work with!!

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
